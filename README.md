## thermoelectric properties

Design criteria for materials with good thermoelectric properties indeed encompass the factors you've mentioned: 
Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT). 

Before we proceed to check the datasets for this information, let's clarify why each of these properties is significant:

Seebeck coefficient: 

This property measures the magnitude of an induced thermoelectric voltage in response to a temperature difference across that material. A high Seebeck coefficient is essential for generating more voltage from a given temperature gradient, which is key for thermoelectric efficiency.


Electrical conductivity: 

Materials with high electrical conductivity enable electrons to move easily, thus reducing Joule heating and energy loss. In thermoelectric materials, good electrical conductivity contributes to the power factor (Seebeck coefficient squared times electrical conductivity).

Thermal conductivity: 

A low thermal conductivity is critical for maintaining a temperature gradient across the thermoelectric material, which is necessary for continuous power generation. High thermal insulation also helps in achieving high thermoelectric efficiency.

Figure of merit (ZT): 

The figure of merit (ZT) is a dimensionless number that describes the efficiency of a thermoelectric material. It is defined as ZT = (S²σT)/κ, where S is the Seebeck coefficient, σ is the electrical conductivity, T is the absolute temperature, and κ is the thermal conductivity. Materials with a ZT greater than 1 are generally considered good for thermoelectric applications.

## litium ion battery

The design criteria for lithium-ion battery materials typically include the following:

Voltage (V): The operating voltage of the material when used as an electrode.

Capacity (mAh/g): The charge capacity per unit mass of the material.

Conductivity: The electrical and ionic conductivities of the material.

Stability: Chemical and thermal stability during battery operation.

Rate Capability: The ability of the electrode material to charge and discharge rapidly.

Cycle Life: The number of charge/discharge cycles the material can endure while maintaining performance.

Safety: Thermal and chemical stability during operation to minimize the risk of fires or explosions.

Before proceeding to create the table, please note that while some of these databases may contain the necessary descriptors needed to predict the above properties (e.g., crystal structure, bandgap, formation energy), they might not have explicit entries for all specific battery-related properties (like cycle life, rate capability), particularly in the context of high-throughput computation.

Thus, for the purposes of this table, I will focus on whether the databases provide information that could be used to infer or calculate these properties, rather than whether they directly list the specific battery property.

Below is the table:
| Criteria | MP | Jarvis | Aflow | OQMD | Nomad | ICSD | Note | 
|-----------------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Voltage (V) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Likely | No | Operating voltages may be estimated from formation and decomposition energies. | 
| Capacity (mAh/g) | Theoretical Calc | Theoretical Calc | Theoretical Calc | Theoretical Calc | Likely | No | Based on theoretical calculations of specific capacity. | 
| Electrical Conductivity | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Electrical conductivity is often calculated from electronic structure data. | 
|Ionic Conductivity | Indirect | Yes | Indirect | Indirect | Indirect | No | May be estimated from atomic diffusion simulations or migration barriers. | 
| Stability | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Thermodynamic stability from formation energy, phase diagrams, etc. | 
| Rate Capability | No | No | No | No | No | No | Often determined experimentally and related to ionic and electronic mobility. | 
| Cycle Life | No | No | No | No | No | No | Typically an experimental property, depends on many factors including stability.| 
| Safety | No | No | No | No | No | No | Safety factors like thermal stability are not directly present in these DBs. |


## photocatalysis for water splitting

To compile a detailed table of design criteria for photocatalysts for water splitting, I'll list the properties relevant to photocatalyst performance which are typically studied:
Bandgap Energy (eV): Determines the light absorption characteristics of the photocatalyst.

Band Edge Positions: Relates to the redox potentials and the ability to perform water oxidation and reduction.

Stability: Chemical robustness in aqueous solutions, especially under illumination.

Surface area: Larger surface areas typically lead to higher catalytic activity due to more active sites.

Charge Carrier Mobility: Affects the recombination rate of electron-hole pairs.

Absorption Spectrum: The range of light wavelengths the material can absorb.

Overpotential: The additional potential required beyond the thermodynamic potential to drive the reaction at a noticeable rate.

We shall check for the availability of these properties directly or indirectly (as inferable from other data) in the mentioned databases and include whether the data is 3D or 2D. However, not all databases contain explicit data for all these properties, and some properties, like overpotential and absorption spectrum, may not be available computationally and require experimental validation.

Here is the table with availability:
| Criteria | MP | Jarvis | Aflow | OQMD | Nomad | ICSD | Others | Data Dimensionality | 
|------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|-----------|---------------------| 
| Bandgap Energy (eV) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | - | 3D | 
| Band Edge Positions | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Indirect | - | 3D | 
| Stability | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | - | 3D | 
| Surface Area | Derived | Derived | Derived | Derived | Derived | No | - | 3D | 
| Charge Carrier Mobility| Derived | Derived | Derived | Derived | Derived | No | - | 3D | 
| Absorption Spectrum | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes | No | - | 3D | 
| Overpotential | No | No | No | No | No | No | - | - |

For the "Others" column, there could be more specialized databases or datasets, such as the Computational Materials Repository (CMR) from the Technical University of Denmark or High-Throughput Experimental Materials (HTEM) Database from NREL, which may contain subsets of data relevant to photocatalysts for water splitting. However, these are not included as separate entries in the table.

The "Yes" designation indicates the databases store direct computational data for the respective criteria. "Derived" suggests that the property can be estimated or inferred from other available data. For example, surface area may be estimated from pore size distributions or crystal morphology. Charge carrier mobility might be derived from electronic band structure and effective mass calculations. "No" indicates the property is not present, and "Indirect" means that related data may exist but not the property itself, requiring further calculation or assumptions.

Legend:
Y: Data is available directly in the database for this property.
I: The data for this property can be indirectly derived or inferred from other available data.
N: Data is not available for this property.
Data Dimensionality: Indicates primarily whether data is available in three-dimensional form, which is typically the case for crystallographic databases.

For critical temperatures, a specialized database such as the SuperCon database from the National Institute for Materials Science (NIMS) may have this information. SuperCon is dedicated to superconducting materials and contains experimentally determined Tc values among other properties.
